# Bookstore
Basic MERN Bookstore: This repository contains a simple bookstore application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It features a RESTful API for managing book data, a responsive React frontend for browsing and purchasing, and MongoDB for storage. Ideal for learning full-stack development with MERN.
